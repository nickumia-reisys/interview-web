## Interview Questions

Bringing a new developer onboard is never easy.  Judging a person's technical ability is a struggle given that everyone
comes from different backgrounds.  Some learned most of their skills in an academic setting; others learned from
practical experience; still others with a healthy mix of both.  I've been interviewed from very different perspectives,
ranging from more abstract conceptual understanding to rigorous technical challenges.  Both provide their own idea of
the problem-solving, creativity and awareness of a person.  The abstract perspective allows big-picture, interdisciplinary
qualities to shine through, while the technical testing shows how those qualities materialize on a real problem.  But enough
high-level philosophical mumbo-jumbo for now haha ðŸ˜…

The interview questions are grouped by the skill their testing (i.e. python questions are in python.py file).  This is a
work-in-progress, but I hope that this helps others not sure how to test their interviewees.  Some questions are pulled
from existing sources, and some are original, they'll be documented, so breadcrumbs can be followed.

Currently supported skills:
- Python
- Database (primarily sql, but rdms in general)
